 * every client, including the owner, so this call will be REJECTED as
 * written. That is intentional and matches the Phase B decision: a client
 * that can create notifications can forge them into its own feed. Phase C4
 * needs a trigger path, and there are exactly two ways to provide one:
 *
 *   1. Relax the rule to allow `create` from the owner, constrained to the
 *      known types (the pragmatic option at this scale — a user can only
 *      pollute their own feed), or
 *   2. Keep the rule closed and move this check server-side (an API route on
 *      the Admin SDK, which bypasses rules).
 *
 * Option 2 is the one that preserves Phase B's model. This function exists so
 * the dashboard has a single, obvious seam to call either way, and so the
 * de-duplication logic lives in one place rather than being duplicated into a
 * route. It fails closed: callers treat a rejection as "no notification",
 * which is the correct degradation.
